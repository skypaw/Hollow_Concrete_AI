# Abaqus_Scripting

Separate part of the project using Python 2.7.18. For sake of integrity of the whole project (dataset is created based
on Abaqus calculations), this module is included in one repository with Deep_Learning part.

Scripts are executed by 'Abaqus python', which is accessible in cmd. This part of the project **won't work without
Abaqus**.
